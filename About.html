    <p>My name is Joshua Odiase, an incoming third year Physics-Data Science Engineering major attending UCLA. You might be wondering why I named my site 'Odyssey' and not after my own name. I chose this, from my time in middle school, nickname, which was a play on my last name and my love for Greek mythology. With Odysseus' journey being testaments to challenges and his search for the Oracle in knowledge which I believe resonates with my story. I'm using this site as an expression of my creative interests and scientific research and background. Why choose one if you can do both?</p>
    <p>My inspiration in the engineering field came from the movie Big Hero 6. Seeing how technology and engineering could be implemented to either help humanity or hurt it, emphasizing the duality of ethics in this space. With this, I gravitated to physics where I saw experimental beauty when in class learning about topics such as chaos in dynamical systems, and eigenspaces in higher dimensions, to name a few. I plan on specializing my university studies in quantum mechanics, which I see having a lot of unknowns and many possible applications that we are seeing being made in our age. With this, I intend to merge my passion for the science in tandem with my technical expertise.</p>
    <p>This site holds my projects being my short films, upcoming coding projects, and research papers in my lab, so stay tuned in and if you're interested in the work I'm doing, feel free to connect with me or send me a personal inquiry.</p>
    <p>Sincerely,</p>
    <p>Joshua Odiase (Odyssey)</p>
